In preparation for this we have carried out a new, low-uncertainty determination of the Boltzmann constant, kB, in terms of which the SI unit of temperature, the kelvin, can be re-defined. We have evaluated kB from exceptionally accurate measurements of the speed of sound in argon gas which can be related directly to the mean molecular kinetic energy, . Our new estimate is kB = 1.380 651 56 (98) × 10−23 J K−1 with a relative standard uncertainty uR = 0.71 × 10−6.}

abstract = {Abstract On May 20, 2019 the values of the Planck, h, and Avogadro, NA, constants will be fixed, revising our measurement system, the International System of Units (SI), and providing a new way to get mass traceability. While the famous energy relations mc2 and hf may remind many that the Planck constant is indeed related to mass, it is less recognized how this is also true for the Avogadro constant. These concepts are reviewed in the context of the upcoming revision of the SI. How the fixed values were chosen and how mass traceability will be maintained with the smallest uncertainty are also discussed.},
